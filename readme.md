# Ocaml Type Inference in Prolog


## Features Implemented by us
* Inference for typical functions and operators (add, multiply, less than, etc.)
* Inference for higher order functions ( @@ apply and |> reverse_apply/pipe)
* Inference for if-statements
* expression computation as a statement
* "let in" statements
* for statements
* code blocks

## Notes:
* Unit tests use functionType instead of typeExpr. Changes to how parameters are stored made typeExpr not work.
